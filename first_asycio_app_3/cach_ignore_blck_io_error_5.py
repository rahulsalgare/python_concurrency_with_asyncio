"""
we get BlockingIOerror because our server socket has
no connection yet and therefore no data to process

to handle this, just catch the exception, ignore it, and keep looping until we
have data

problem with this code:
This approach works, but it comes at a cost. The first is code quality. Catching
exceptions any time we might not yet have data will quickly get verbose and is poten-
tially error-prone. The second is a resource issue. If you run this on a laptop, you may
notice your fan starts to sound louder after a few seconds. This application will always
be using nearly 100% of our CPUâ€™s processing power. This is because we
are constantly looping and getting exceptions as fast as we can inside our application,
leading to a workload that is CPU heavy.
